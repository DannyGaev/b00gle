THIS IS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROJECT. PLEASE DO NOT GET FREAKY, EVIL, SINISTER, OR COMMIT CRIMES USING B00GLE -- IT'S BAD FOR ME AND YOU, BUT MAINLY FOR YOU.


A domain_variations.txt file with popular google domains such as gmail, google, and youtube comes pre-loaded with b00gle. If you would like to replace the file with a new domain_variations.txt, execute the following command:
	./variations.exe domain1.com domain2.com domain3.com ... domainN.com
to generate a new domain.variations.txt file. Move this new text file into htdocs, and delete the old version.
